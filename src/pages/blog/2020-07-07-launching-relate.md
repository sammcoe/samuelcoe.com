Today, I’m very excited to launch Relate, a new app for relationship building.

[TL;DR Check it out here](https://relateios.app)

Relate allows you to track the health and progression of relationships, whether they be friendly, familial, or romantic. The goal is to facilitate better communication and more intentional interactions with those you care about or want to get to know.

The inspiration behind Relate comes from my own admitted failures in communication.  I care deeply about the people in my life, but I also have a very busy mind and, like many of us today, an overly busy life.  I’m a husband, father, employee, etc… I spend the majority of my day in moments or situations that don’t exactly facilitate starting a meaningful conversation with somebody I’m thinking about— let alone giving them a call.  

So often a person crosses my mind and I think “I really need to get in touch with them and see how they’re doing” and I almost always follow it up with an earnest “I’ll do that tonight”.  I rarely do.  I leave work (these days, I just walk out of a room), spend time with my kids, eat dinner, get kids in bed, spend time with my wife, and all thoughts of the outside world are lost.  I wanted to make something to hold me more accountable upfront— remind me at a pre-determined time of day and *don’t stop reminding me* until I do the thing.

Additionally, while forgetfulness is my enemy in remembering to reach out, it also rears its head when it comes to remembering conversational details.  For this reason, I wanted to lay a more robust foundation for Relate.  Relate will surface important details and encourage the addition of notes for each new interaction.

While the idea of needing this type of tool may sound crazy to some, I believe many others like me will find great value in it.  I made Relate for you. For us.  It won’t do all the work for you and it shouldn’t— but I hope it removes as much friction as possible.

I have quite a few cool ideas for ways to continue molding Relate into a feature-rich assistant and I look forward to continuing on that journey with you.
