                  I am from, and still resident to, a small town in Illinois called Marion.  Growing up in a rural, small town environment instilled in me a love of peace and the country, but also a desire for bigger, more exciting things.  As I get older, I'm less inclined towards the city-pull that I once felt so strongly.  Maybe it's because of the high levels of stress that I've already subjected myself to.  Maybe it's simply because of changes in my life or getting older itself.  I've also come to understand myself more-- I hate crowds.<br><br>
                  From an early age I've had an affinity for gadgets and computers.  As a young child I loved getting ahold of the TV remotes and, as I got older, learned to appreciate the family computer with all the goodness that Windows 95 had to offer.  My father is a fairly accomplished artist and that's how the bread was won during my childhood, but when I was about 9 years old he decided to go to college.  He studied Computer Science, and so computers and technology grew even more important in my young life.  I developed an even greater fascination with computer software, hardware, and technology in general.<br><br>
                  During Keyboarding class I would finish early and work on projects from a Visual Studio book that our instructor happened to have lying around.  As I entered my teens, my interest in building computers, tinkering with software (more as a consumer), and-- of course-- playing video games increased.  What did not increase was my understanding of how all these things that I loved worked.  I had plans from this early stage of my life to follow in my dad's steps and go into the field of Computer Science.  Considering my future plans, it's strange that I look back and consider the stagnation of my development knowledge during the middle years of my life.  I really don't know if it was lack of confidence in the "proper" direction to move or all the other worries of a typical teenager that left me dormant.  Most likely some combination of the two.<br><br>
                  The good news is that I came through this quiet stage of my life and took to my general future and my future in development with renewed fervor.   By the time I started college at a local community college, I had prepared myself to have an accelerated start in my programming curriculum.  When an advisement error had me skipping my first pre-requisite programming class, I was able to convince the instructor to allow me to prove that I had a solid enough grasp of the concepts to skip that class and advance to the one that I had mistakenly been registered for.  This wonderful instructor spent her summer sending me assignments and reviewing them-- I still look back and marvel at what a wonderful example she is of what it means to truly be a teacher.<br><br>
                  During my second year of college, I got my first job at a technology company that has a satellite office near my home town.  They allowed me to work part-time hours and, though I wasn't a developer per-se, I was a technical analyst and there was plenty of development involved and I had my foot in the door for bigger opportunities.  I was ecstatic for this opportunity-- being quite an incredible one for someone with a mere one year of college under his belt.<br><br>
                  In the summer before my third year of college, I decided to ask my then-girlfriend to marry me.  This was such a huge step forward in my life, but I felt like I had all my ducks in a row and took the plunge.  With this massive change of circumstance looming in the near future, I took a full-time position at the company I was working for.  And so, in order to put some money back, I worked full-time and went to school full-time through my third year of college and my first year at Southern Illinois University.  My wife and I were married immediately following finals week that spring.<br><br>
                  My last year of college added one more exciting block to the stack of responsibility I was building for myself.  Marriage.  On top of a full-time job.  On top of being a full-time student.  This is something that I realize many people experience; however, few people run headlong into it _at the age of 20._  It was this experience that profoundly grew my respect for my own father and all those others who have done something to improve their families' future while still having to provide for them in the present-- and he did it with children.<br><br>
                  Shortly after the beginning of my final year of college I made a key position change in the company I was working for, taking on a more challenging technical role on a different team.<br><br>
                  Part of the Bachelor's of Science curriculum for Computer Science degree I was pursuing is the proof of skills learned by means of implementing a "Senior Project."  This is essentially a course that spans both semesters of the last year of school.  It's typical for a number of companies to approach the department with projects that they would like to see implemented.  Groups of students would team up and take on these projects.  Atypically, one of my classmates had his own project that he wanted to pursue and I was immediately drawn to this project.  Once the project was approved by the department, I excitedly added "working on a technology start-up" to my list responsibilities for that year.<br><br>
                  It was definitely an interesting experience, working on building a start-up while also using it to fulfill requirements for what is essentially a college course.  The whole thing was fantastic and a huge growing experience for my professional self.  We had all the late-night coding sessions and energy drink-induced sprints that you would expect out of such a venture.  We had grand ideas for what this product would be and how it could revolutionize our target audience.  It died when we graduated.  I'm proud of this failure; you don't fail unless you do something, and we definitely did something.  When it was all said and done, though, we all graduated and went our different directions with our own responsibilities to find our individual ways in the world.  I could go into greater detail on that venture, but ultimately that's where it takes its leave from my story.  I'm left with the knowledge, experiences, and a couple pretty cool relationships that it built.<br><br>
                  Shortly after I graduated, and less than a year after moving teams at the company I worked for, I was promoted to the technical lead position on the team, and about half a year after that I was promoted to be the manger of that same team.  Having no prior management experience, but a deep technical understanding of the field, I took to the position easily and eagerly.  I had a great relationship with the people I worked with and I was happy to be moving everyone forward as a team.<br><br>
                  Two months into my new position, my wife gave birth to our first son.  No, this wasn't unexpected, we had known it was coming for eight months; however, it absolutely changed our lives.<br><br>
                  The amount of responsibility I had teen for myself was tremendous for a 23-year-old.  Did I mention we bought a house before having the baby? Oh yeah, we bought a house before having the baby.  And a car immediately after.  You have to move that baby around in safety.  Writing this, I feel like I'm tracing through the call stack of a particularly obvious error.<br><br>
                  Too much. Too fast.<br><br>
                  Combine the various stressors and changes that come along with a new baby (I won't even begin to get in to the psychology of that change) with the stress of managing a 20-person high-profile technical team and you've got a classic recipe for burn-out.<br><br>
                  When I came to understand where my priorities needed to be and where I needed to cut back, I decided to make some serious changes and go back to the fundamentals or what I wanted in my career.  I decided to take a step back (or forward, as I personally see it) and move into a frontend application development role.  I made the decision to start working on my own projects, actively contributing more to open-source projects, and helping build other developers up along side myself.<br><br>
                  Before any changes could happen, another baby came into our lives. When my first son was about six months old, my wife got pregnant again... unexpectedly, but not inexplicably.  We've since figured out how that works.  At the time of writing this, we have a wonderful 4-week-old newborn son.<br><br>
                  Yes, this brings you right up to day of writing this.  I've newly dedicated myself to working towards and enjoying only the things I truly love and enjoy: my family, my friends, and making cool things with cool people.<br><br>
