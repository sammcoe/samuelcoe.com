title: The Art of Manliness
text: "A blog dedicated to uncovering the lost art of being a man. AoM is a blog about growing up well, aimed at men and their unique challenges and interests. They explore all things manly — from the serious and philosophical to the practical and fun. They seek to uncover how to live with grandpa’s swagger, virtue, and know-how in the present age by wedding the best of the past to the best of the present. The end goal is to create a synergy of tradition and modernity that offers men a way forward and signposts on how to live an excellent, flourishing life."
