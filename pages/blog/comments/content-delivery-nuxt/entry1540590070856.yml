  Great article!  I'm working on a project somewhat related to this.  I'm using
  nuxt to generate a static website that is hosted on netlify.  My website
  content is stored on firebase.  I can add or edit content directly through a
  admin page on the site that is restricted by a login.  After content is either
  added or updated, I use a cloud function to trigger a rebuild of the website
  using a netlify webhook.
